# Clustering Research Papers Abstracts

## Intoduction 

An Abstract is a short statement about the paper designed to give the reader a complete, yet concise, understanding of your paper's research and findings.
And usually people who search for a paper they read the abstract first because it represents the whole paper's content in a short text. So in this project, we will cluster the papers based on their abstarct.
